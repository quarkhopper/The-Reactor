# GenSystem Development Plan

## Core Components
1. **Secondary Loop**
   - Heat exchanger interface with primary loop
   - Secondary coolant flow mechanics
   - Temperature differential monitoring

2. **Turbine System**
   - Connect to RPM gauge for visualization
   - Implement steam-driven rotation mechanics
   - Add efficiency curves based on steam conditions

3. **Secondary Pump Cluster**
   - Flow rate controls
   - Pressure management
   - Integration with secondary loop

## UI/Display Updates
1. **Power Grid Interface**
   - Digital displays showing external grid demand
   - Implement oscillating demand function with noise
   - Real-time power output vs demand comparison

2. **New Indicators**
   - Steam quality/pressure in secondary loop
   - Turbine efficiency metrics
   - Grid stability indicators

## Implementation Order
1. Secondary loop core mechanics
2. Turbine and RPM systems
3. Pump cluster integration
4. Power demand simulation
5. UI indicators and displays
