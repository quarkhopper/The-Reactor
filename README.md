# The Reactor Project

**Code Name:** `The Reactor`  
**Purpose:** A visually satisfying web application simulating a complex state machine through an interactive, cryptic control panel.

---

## üåê Project Overview

**The Reactor** is an aesthetic-driven application designed to mimic an industrial control panel. It is not meant to simulate a real-world reactor but to *feel* like a high-stakes system through satisfying feedback and mysterious behavior.

The core idea revolves around:
- **User interaction** with buttons, toggles, and sliders.
- A **dynamic state machine** reacting to those inputs.
- A feeling of **chaotic-but-contained equilibrium**, where each input causes the system to shift, adapt, and seek a new point of homeostasis.

---

## üß† Goals

- Create an **interactive UI** with visual depth and sensory feedback.
- Simulate a **stateful system** with complex internal logic.
- Trigger **animated auxiliary systems**, alarms, or shifting states in response to changes.
- Develop a **startup and shutdown sequence** for immersion.

## üîß Technical Overview

### Frontend (Current Focus)

- **Framework:** React (using TypeScript)
- **Styling:** Custom CSS with a focus on maintainable, component-specific styles
- **Component Libraries:**
  - `shadcn/ui` for basic UI elements
  - `lucide-react` for icons
  - `framer-motion` for animations and transitions

#### Interface Concepts

- A grid-based **control panel** with:
  - Light-up **buttons** and **toggles**
  - Flickering **indicator lights**
  - **Sliders**, **knobs**, and **rotating gauges**
- Dynamic lighting to simulate:
  - System pressure
  - Load levels
  - Temperature or other cryptic variables

#### Visual Goals

- Everything should feel **responsive and alive**
- Activations trigger short **animations or sound cues**
- Interface has a clear **startup sequence**, booting subsystems and initializing lights/sounds in order
- **Shutdown sequence** ends in a slow fade or flickering power-down

### Core System Design

The reactor core is simulated through a multidimensional arrangement of physical elements:

- **Fuel Rod Tensor**: Represents fuel rod presence and configuration, directly influencing power generation
- **Control Rod Tensor**: Affects neutron absorption, regulating reaction intensity through slider controls
- **Moderator Tensor**: Modifies reactivity in combination with fuel and control rods
- **Secondary Tensors**: Represent thermal buildup, geometric instability, and system momentum

The system computes a solution each tick based on these interacting tensors, affecting:
- Core heat and pressure
- Power output
- Subsystem warning states
- Potential faults or instability

### State Management

- **Centralized Component Registry**: Single source of truth for all component IDs and metadata
- **State Transition Manager**: Handles all state transitions with validation and timing
- **Event Bus System**: Facilitates communication between components and the core system
- **Process Managers**: Manage initialization, testing, startup, and shutdown sequences

### Backend (Future Phase)

- **Node.js server** for:
  - Coordinating user interaction logs (if multiplayer added)
  - Optional Discord bot integration
  - Optional persistent state/history using PostgreSQL

#### Discord Integration (Later)

- Allow Discord users to trigger events, view logs, or initiate remote startups/shutdowns
- Potential for collaborative chaos mode where multiple users influence the reactor in real time

## üß† Design Principles

- Interactions should be **tactile and rewarding**
- System behavior should feel **emergent**, not rigid
- No need for player success/failure‚Äîjust immersion
- Complexity should be **hinted**, not explained
- The system's "lore" is embedded in its behavior

---

## üìù Notes & Considerations

- Avoid real physics simulation‚Äîit's about the *feel*, not the realism
- Use *delay*, *lighting*, and *motion* to simulate system depth
- Subtlety: not every interaction should have an obvious effect
- Chaos mode is encouraged‚Äîrandomization with limits
- Control panel should feel like it was built by a now-defunct organization with no documentation
