# Bill of Materials (BOM) â€” The Fidget Reactor

> **Project Phase:** In-silico design and test harness mapping
> 
> This file tracks the evolving hardware plan for The Fidget Reactor â€” a tactile simulation panel integrating buttons, lights, displays, and analog controls. The BOM is versioned alongside source code and should reflect only parts likely to exist in the final real-world build.

## ðŸ”Œ Buses, Power, and Wiring

| Type         | Usage & Notes |
|--------------|---------------|
| IÂ²C          | Ideal for low-speed, addressable subsystems: sliders, toggle switches, LED bar drivers. Keep device count limited per bus to avoid latency. |
| SPI          | Best for high-throughput LEDs (RGB panels, 7-segments). Dedicated lines per subsystem to reduce wiring congestion. |
| UART         | Use for debug or isolated ATtiny subsystems (e.g. SCRAM logic or turbine gauge servo). |
| GPIO expanders | MCP23017 for button grids, control rod LEDs. Consider one per subsystem to simplify wiring. |
| Power rails  | 3.3V for logic (ESP/ATtiny), 5V for displays/LEDs. Use a central buck regulator module (e.g. MP1584) and distribute via wide trace or power rail under panel. |

**Layout Notes:**
- Mount ESP32 and voltage regulators centrally, under the SCRAM/master button cluster.
- Route SPI/IÂ²C buses radially to each edge cluster (e.g. fuel rod grid, grid displays, top panel).
- Break LED and button groups into physical/functional clusters to reduce connector count.
- Consider layered vertical PCBs for tall sections (needle gauges, LED bars) to avoid deep wire routing.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Fuel rod buttons and LEDs should be visually integrated â€” consider concentric light rings.
- Plan early for power draw from LED clusters and segment displays.
- Consider combining vertical LED bars using pre-binned strips or matrix drivers.
- Bus layout should minimize contention and bottlenecks â€” subdivide by subsystem.
- SPI for all display and LED logic; IÂ²C or GPIO expanders for controls; UART only for isolated subsystems.
- Use PCB-mounted JST connectors per cluster to simplify wiring and assembly.
