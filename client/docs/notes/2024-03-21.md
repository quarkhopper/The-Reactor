# March 21, 2024 - Documentation and System Refinement

## Today's Work
- Reviewed and updated documentation across three key files:
  - `state_machine.md`: Streamlined process management sections, removed redundancies
  - `reactor_operation.md`: Enhanced shutdown behavior documentation
  - `component_pattern.md`: Updated command patterns and examples
- Improved code organization and reduced verbosity in logging
- Fixed state transition logging during shutdown process
- Ensured proper component behavior during shutdown states

## Tomorrow's Plans
1. Implement ConditionPanel behavior
2. Work on cooling system implementation
3. Develop load system functionality
4. Fix scram button functionality (currently non-operational)

## Notes
- Scram button needs repair - currently not functioning
- Documentation now better reflects actual implementation
- System shutdown behavior has been verified and documented
