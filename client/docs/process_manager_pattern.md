# Process Manager Pattern

## Overview
The Process Manager Pattern is a design approach used in The Reactor application to manage state transitions and process orchestration. This pattern ensures modularity, scalability, and clear separation of concerns by isolating the logic for each process into dedicated manager classes.

## Key Components

1. **MessageBus**: Acts as the central communication hub for all components. Managers subscribe to the `MessageBus` to listen for relevant messages and emit events to signal process changes.

2. **StateMachine**: Coordinates the overall application state and validates state transitions. It interacts with process managers to ensure proper sequencing.

3. **Process Managers**: Dedicated classes (e.g., `InitManager`, `TestManager`, `StartupManager`, `ShutdownManager`) that handle specific processes. Each manager is responsible for:
   - Subscribing to relevant messages.
   - Emitting `process_begin` and `process_complete` events.
   - Managing the lifecycle of its process.

## General Structure of a Process Manager

Each process manager follows a consistent structure:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Managers are constructed during the first pass and initialized during the second pass.
   - The `init()` method subscribes to the `MessageBus` and sets up any required state.

2. **Message Handling**:
   - Managers define a guard function (e.g., `isInitManagerMessage`, `isTestManagerMessage`) to filter relevant messages.
   - A `handleMessage` method processes incoming messages and triggers appropriate actions.

3. **Process Lifecycle**:
   - Managers emit `process_begin` when a process starts and `process_complete` when it ends.
   - They track the progress of their process (e.g., acknowledgments in `InitManager`, test results in `TestManager`).

## Example: InitManager

The `InitManager` handles the "init" process:

- **Initialization**:
  - Subscribes to the `MessageBus`.
  - Tracks component IDs and acknowledgments.

- **Message Handling**:
  - Listens for `state_change` and `acknowledge` messages.
  - Emits `process_begin` when entering the "init" state.

- **Process Completion**:
  - Emits `process_complete` when all components acknowledge initialization.

## Example: TestManager

The `TestManager` handles the "test" process:

- **Initialization**:
  - Subscribes to the `MessageBus`.
  - Tracks tested components and prevents duplicate transitions.

- **Message Handling**:
  - Listens for `state_change` and `test_result` messages.
  - Emits `process_begin` for each component when entering the "test" state.

- **Process Completion**:
  - Emits `process_complete` when all components complete their test sequence.

## Example: StartupManager

The `StartupManager` handles the "startup" process:

- **Initialization**:
  - Subscribes to the `MessageBus`.
  - Tracks startup progress and ensures all components are ready.

- **Message Handling**:
  - Listens for `state_change` and `acknowledge` messages.
  - Emits `process_begin` when entering the "startup" state.

- **Process Completion**:
  - Emits `process_complete` when all components are ready for operation.

## Example: ShutdownManager

The `ShutdownManager` handles the "shutdown" process:

- **Initialization**:
  - Subscribes to the `MessageBus`.
  - Tracks shutdown progress and ensures all components are safely powered down.

- **Message Handling**:
  - Listens for `state_change` and `acknowledge` messages.
  - Emits `process_begin` when entering the "shutdown" state.

- **Process Completion**:
  - Emits `process_complete` when all components are safely powered down.

## Benefits of the Pattern

1. **Modularity**: Each process manager encapsulates its logic, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend.
2. **Scalability**: New processes can be added by creating additional managers without affecting existing ones.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: The `StateMachine` handles state transitions, while managers handle process-specific logic.

## Best Practices

1. Use guard functions to filter relevant messages.
2. Ensure managers emit `process_begin` and `process_complete` events for their processes.
3. Track progress using appropriate data structures (e.g., sets for acknowledgments or test results).
4. Avoid duplicate transitions by using flags (e.g., `transitionInProgress` in `TestManager`).

By adhering to this pattern, The Reactor application achieves a robust and maintainable architecture for managing complex state transitions and processes.
